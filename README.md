# docker-images

Contains various Docker build files for creating Docker images (base images, intermediate images, etc.). 

Each folder is designated to one particular image, and has a Dockerfile (besides other build related stuff). 

Every Dockerfile is well commented and should be consulted for more information what it represents.
